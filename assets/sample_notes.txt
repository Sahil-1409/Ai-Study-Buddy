Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are fundamental in computer science. 
A data structure organizes data effectively. Common ones: arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs. 
Arrays give fast index access, linked lists give efficient insertion/deletion. 
Algorithms are step-by-step procedures. Complexity matters: binary search is O(log n), linear search is O(n). 
Stacks (LIFO) are used for undo and function calls. Queues (FIFO) for scheduling. 
Trees organize hierarchically, e.g., binary search trees with O(log n) average search. 
Graphs model relations: BFS explores level by level, DFS goes deep. 
Choosing the right structure and algorithm ensures efficient problem solving.
